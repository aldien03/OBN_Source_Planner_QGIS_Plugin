# OBN_Source_Planner_QGIS_Plugin
This QGIS plugin automates, streamlines, and optimizes the planning process for Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey source lines. It is designed to support survey planners by integrating data import, spatial algorithms, and interactive simulation tools directly within the QGIS.
